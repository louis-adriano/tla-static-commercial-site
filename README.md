## Font Installation Instructions

This project is currently using Montserrat as a placeholder font. To use Futura PT as intended:

1. Purchase a license for Futura PT if you don't already have one
2. Create a directory at `/public/fonts/`
3. Add the following Futura PT font files (WOFF2 format is recommended):
   - FuturaPTLight.woff2
   - FuturaPTBook.woff2
   - FuturaPTMedium.woff2
   - FuturaPTDemi.woff2
   - FuturaPTBold.woff2

4. Update the `app/layout.tsx` file to use the local font files instead of Google Fonts

## Color Scheme
